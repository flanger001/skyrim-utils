# SkyrimUtils

This silly gem decodes Skyrim save file names and exposes a small database with those names. Eventually it will also read the save files themselves!

## A note on usage

Skyrim is only officially supported on Windows. This was intended to be used from WSL reaching into the Windows file system. As such, your paths will look similar to those in the [`test`](/test) directory.

This could also be used on Windows directly, but I have not tried it.
